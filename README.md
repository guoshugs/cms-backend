## ⚙️ How to Run (Local Dev)

1. **Prepare Local Services**:
   - MySQL (`192.168.211.128:3306`)
   - Redis (`6379`)
   - Nacos (`192.168.211.128:8848`)
   - RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch if needed

2. **Set up MySQL Database**:
   - Create databases (e.g., `leadnews_admin`, `leadnews_article`, etc.)
   - Import SQL files if available

3. **Edit Configuration**:
   - Adjust DB config in each `application.yml` (host, port, password)
   - Ensure all services point to correct Nacos and DB

4. **Run Services**:
   - Start `leadnews-gateway`
   - Start needed services in `leadnews-service/*`

5. **Access API**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:9000/` (via gateway)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- All secrets (e.g., `aliyun.properties`) have been removed before publishing.
- The system uses default local DB credentials (e.g., `root/123456`) and **is not exposed to the public internet**.
- Environment-specific settings (such as `Nacos`, `Redis`, `RabbitMQ`) are designed for **internal/private use only**.
